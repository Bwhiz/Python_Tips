# Big Number Readability

This repository introduces a useful trick to make big numbers more readable in Python
without affecting arithmetic operations. The trick involves using underscores ( ) to separate
zeros in large numbers, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the magnitude of the
number.

## Usage

To use this trick, simply insert underscores between the zeros in your large numbers. For
example, instead of writing 1000000000 you can write °1_000 000_000°. This makes the
number easier to read while still allowing you to perform arithmetic operations on it as usual
Benefits
This trick has a number of benefits for professionals who work with large numbers on a
regular basis. It can be especially useful for teachers, scientists, finance quants, accountants,
quantum physicists, actuaries, traders, and anyone else who deals with large numbers frequently.

Using underscores to separate zeros in large numbers makes it easier to read and
understand the magnitude of the number at a glance. This can save time and reduce the risk
of errors when working with large numbers.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use underscores to make a large number more readable:

without underscore
large_number = 1000000000000000000000000

with underscore
large number = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000

As you can see, using underscores to separate zeros makes the number much easier to read
and understand.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this repository provides useful trick for making large numbers more
readable in Python. By using underscores to separate zeros, users can quickly grasp the
magnitude of a number without affecting its arithmetic operations. This trick can be
beneficial for professionals who regularly work with large numbers and can save time and
reduce the risk of errors.
