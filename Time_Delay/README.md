# Time Delay
This repository contains a Python script that uses the `time` module to introduce a delay in the execution of the program.

## Script Functionality
The script imports the `time` module and calls its `sleep` function to pause the execution of the program for 2 seconds. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when you need to wait for a resource to become available or when you want to introduce a delay between two actions in your program.

## Prerequisites
To run the script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Additionally, the script uses the `time` module, which is included with Python, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage
To introduce a delay in your Python program, simply import the `time` module and use the `sleep` function with the number of seconds you want the program to pause. For example, to introduce a 2 second delay, use the following code:
```
import time
time.sleep(2)
```

This will cause the program to pause for 2 seconds before continuing with the rest of the code.
