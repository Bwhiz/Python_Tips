# Dictionary Merge:
Here is a fantastic Python tip that will helo you merge two or more dictionaries in pyhton in a very easy and efficient way. We use ** notation for **kwargs-like objects (values with names like dictionaries) to merge them conveninently.

{**d1, **d2}

You do that and Python will take care of the rest.
