# Python Trick: Break up Strings with Split Method

The split method is a powerful function in Python that allows you to easily split a string into multiple substrings based on a specified delimiter. This function can be very useful in a wide range of applications, including data science, website development, database applications, and many more.

## Syntax

The syntax for the split method is as follows:

```python
string.split(separator, maxsplit)
where:

* string: the string you want to split
* separator: the character or string to use as the delimiter for splitting the string (optional, default is   whitespace)
* maxsplit: the maximum number of splits to perform (optional)

## Explanation
In this example, we first create a string variable string with the value "Hello World". We then call the split method on this string, passing in a space character as the separator. The result is a list of two strings, "Hello" and "World", which we store in the variable result.

## Usage
To use the split method, simply provide the string that you want to split as the first argument, and optionally provide the separator and maximum number of splits as the second and third arguments, respectively.

## Conclusion
The split method is a simple yet powerful function that can save you a lot of time and effort when working with strings in Python. By knowing how to use this function, you can easily split a string into multiple substrings based on a delimiter of your choice, allowing you to manipulate and analyze text data in a wide range of applications.
