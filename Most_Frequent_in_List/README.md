# Python Tip: Finding the most common element in a list

## Description

This code snippet demonstrates how to find the most common element in a list of elements in Python. It uses the `max` function with the `key` argument to determine the element that appears most frequently in the list.

## Usage

To use this code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code and paste it into a Python script or IDE.
2. Run the script or execute the code.
3. When prompted, input a list of elements separated by commas.
4. The script will determine the most common element in the list and print it to the console.

Here's an example input and output:

PROMPT: Input your list separated by , : apple,banana,apple,orange,apple,pear
OUTPUT: apple


## Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. The user is prompted to input a list of elements separated by commas using the `input` function.

2. The `split` method is used to convert the input string into a list of strings.

3. The `max` function is used to find the most common element in the list. This is done by passing a set of the list (to remove duplicates) and the `key` argument, which specifies a function to be called on each element to determine its value for comparison. In this case, we're using the `count` method of the original list to count how many times each element appears.

4. The most common element is stored in the `most_common` variable.

5. The most common element is printed to the console using the `print` function.

This code snippet can be used as a starting point for solving similar problems that involve finding the most common element in a list.
