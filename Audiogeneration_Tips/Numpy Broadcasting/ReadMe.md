# Audio Generation using NumPy Broadcasting in Python

This is a Python code example demonstrating audio signal generation using NumPy broadcasting. The code uses NumPy broadcasting to apply a fade-in effect to an audio signal generated as a numpy array. The fade-in effect is applied by multiplying the audio signal with a linear ramp, creating a smooth transition from silence to the full amplitude of the audio signal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```
    pip install numpy
    ```

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the `audio_generation_using_numpy_broadcasting.py` file in a Python environment or IDE.

4. Modify the parameters `duration`, `frequency`, `sampling_rate`, `amplitude`, and `fade_in_duration` in the code to customize the audio signal to be generated and the fade-in effect.

5. Run the code to generate the audio signal as a NumPy array and apply the fade-in effect using NumPy broadcasting.

6. The generated audio signal with the fade-in effect applied will be stored in the `audio_data` NumPy array.

## Code Explanation

The `audio_generation_using_numpy_broadcasting.py` code can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Define the parameters such as `duration`, `frequency`, `sampling_rate`, `amplitude`, and `fade_in_duration` to customize the audio signal to be generated and the fade-in effect.

2. Generate a time array `t` using `np.linspace` to represent the time points of the audio signal.

3. Use NumPy broadcasting to generate the audio signal as a NumPy array by applying the sine wave equation with the specified frequency, amplitude, and time values to the time array `t`.

4. Generate a linear ramp for the fade-in effect using `np.linspace` with a start value of 0, an end value of 1, and a number of samples equal to the number of fade-in samples calculated from the fade-in duration and sampling rate.

5. Apply the fade-in effect to the audio signal using NumPy broadcasting by multiplying the audio signal with the fade-in ramp. The fade-in ramp will be broadcasted to match the shape of the audio signal, creating a smooth transition from silence to the full amplitude of the audio signal.

6. The generated audio signal with the fade-in effect applied is stored in the `audio_data` NumPy array.
