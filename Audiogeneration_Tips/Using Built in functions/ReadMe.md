# Audio Generation using Built-in Functions in Python

This is a Python code example demonstrating how to generate an audio signal using built-in functions. The code uses `numpy` to create an example audio signal as a numpy array, and then uses built-in functions to normalize the amplitude of the audio signal.

## Usage

1. Open a Python environment or IDE.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into the Python environment or IDE.

3. Adjust the `audio_data` variable to contain your desired audio signal. You can modify the values in the numpy array to represent your audio signal.

4. Run the code to generate the audio signal and normalize its amplitude.

5. The `audio_data_normalized` variable will contain the normalized audio signal, which can be further processed or used as needed.

## Code Explanation

The code generates an example audio signal using `numpy` to create a numpy array called `audio_data` containing the audio signal. The `audio_data` variable is then normalized using built-in functions in Python.

In this example, the `max` function from the `numpy` module is used to find the maximum absolute amplitude value in the `audio_data` array. The `map` function is then used with a lambda function to divide each element in the `audio_data` array by the maximum amplitude value, effectively normalizing the audio signal to have values between -1 and 1. The normalized audio signal is stored in the `audio_data_normalized` variable.

Note: Normalizing the amplitude of an audio signal is a common preprocessing step to ensure that the signal is within a certain range for further processing or playback.
