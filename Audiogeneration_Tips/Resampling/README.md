# Audio Generation using Resampling in Python

This is a Python code example demonstrating how to generate an audio signal using resampling technique. The code uses the `resample` function from the `scipy.signal` module to resample an example audio signal to a target sampling rate, effectively changing the pitch and duration of the audio.

## Usage

1. Open a Python environment or IDE.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into the Python environment or IDE.

3. Adjust the parameters such as `duration`, `frequency`, `sampling_rate`, and `target_sampling_rate` to your desired values.

4. Run the code to generate the audio signal using resampling.

5. The `resampled_audio_data` variable will contain the resampled audio signal, which can be saved to a file or further processed as needed.

## Code Explanation

The code generates an example audio signal using `numpy` to create a sinusoidal wave with a specified duration, frequency, and sampling rate. The `resample` function from the `scipy.signal` module is then used to resample the audio signal to a target sampling rate.

Resampling is a technique used to change the sampling rate of an audio signal, effectively changing the pitch and duration of the audio. In this example, the `resample` function is applied to the `audio_data` array with the target sampling rate specified as `int(duration * target_sampling_rate)` to obtain the resampled audio signal in the `resampled_audio_data` variable.

Note: Resampling can introduce artifacts or loss of quality in the audio signal, so it's important to choose appropriate parameters and carefully consider the implications of changing the sampling rate.
