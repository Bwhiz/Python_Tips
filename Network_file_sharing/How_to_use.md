# How to Use the `main.py` Script to Start a Simple HTTP Server in Python

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` script is located.

2. Run the following command to start the HTTP server:

```
python3 main.py
```

This command will execute the `python3 -m http.server` command, which starts a simple HTTP server on port 8000 by default.

3. After the server is started, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the contents of the directory where the HTTP server is running.

4. To stop the HTTP server, go back to the terminal window and press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the server process.

Starting a simple HTTP server using the `main.py` script is a quick and easy way to share files or collaborate on a project over a local network. However, for more complex projects, it's recommended to use a more robust web server such as Apache or Nginx.
